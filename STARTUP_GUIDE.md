# Atom.js Order-Agnostic Startup Guide

## Overview

Atom.js has been enhanced to support **completely order-agnostic startup**. You can now start your microservices in any order, and they will automatically discover and connect to each other as they become available.

## Key Features

### üîÑ Automatic Retry Logic
- **Redis Connection**: Nucleus retries Redis connection for ~5 minutes (50 attempts √ó 6s intervals)
- **Service Discovery**: Interfaces automatically retry failed connections when target services come online
- **Graceful Degradation**: Services continue running even if dependencies aren't immediately available

### üîç Service Discovery
- Uses Redis + Diont for distributed service discovery
- Services announce themselves when ready
- Other services automatically detect and connect to newly available services

### üí™ Connection Resilience
- Failed connections automatically retry when target services become available
- Connection state is maintained and restored
- ZeroMQ handles transport-level resilience

## Startup Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Ideal Startup (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Start Redis (if not already running)
redis-server

# 2. Start your microservices in any order
node service-a.js &
node service-b.js &
node service-c.js &
```

### Scenario 2: Redis Not Running Initially
```bash
# Start services first - they'll wait and retry
node service-a.js &
node service-b.js &

# Start Redis later - services will automatically connect
redis-server
```

### Scenario 3: Services Started in Random Order
```bash
# Any order works!
node service-c.js &
node service-a.js &
redis-server &
node service-b.js &
```

## Configuration Example

Your service configuration remains the same:

```javascript
const Atom = require('atom');

const InterfaceSpecs = {
  name: "@vritti/composer",
  config: {
    port: 8057,
    lexicon: {
      "CompositionExplorerService": lexicon.BaseMsg,
      // ... other lexicon entries
    },
    connections: {
      "NewChainOfThoughtCreated": "@vritti/ideator|||new-chain-of-thought-created<-->OnNewChainOfThoughtCreated",
      "ChainOfThoughtUpdated": "@vritti/ideator|||cot-graph-updated<-->OnChainOfThoughtUpdated"
    },
    eventHandlers: {
      "composition-status-update": eventHandlers.OnCompositionStatusUpdate,
      // ... other handlers
    }
  }
}

global._interface = new Atom.Interface(InterfaceSpecs);
_interface.advertiseAndActivate();
```

## How Connections Work

### Publishing Events
```javascript
// This will work regardless of startup order
_interface.publish("composition-status-update", {
  status: "processing",
  progress: 75
});
```

### Connection Resolution
1. **Immediate Success**: If target service is available, connection establishes immediately
2. **Retry on Failure**: If target service isn't available, the system:
   - Logs the failure
   - Sets up a listener for `AgentActivated` events
   - Automatically retries when the target service comes online

## Retry Configuration

### Nucleus (Redis Connection)
- **Max Attempts**: 50 (configurable via `AtomNucleus.maxRetryAttempts`)
- **Retry Delay**: 6 seconds (configurable via `AtomNucleus.retryDelay`)
- **Total Wait Time**: ~5 minutes

### Interface (Nucleus Connection)  
- **Max Attempts**: 30 (configurable via `process.maxNucleusRetryAttempts`)
- **Retry Delay**: 6 seconds (configurable via `process.nucleusRetryDelay`)
- **Total Wait Time**: ~3 minutes

## Monitoring Startup

### Console Output Examples

**Successful Connection:**
```
AtomNucleus redisClient connected
Nucleus connection established successfully
Info: Atom.Interface advertised - @vritti/composer
```

**Retry in Progress:**
```
WARNING: Redis connection failed - Retry attempt 5/50 in 6s
WARNING: Nucleus connection failed - Retry attempt 2/30 in 6s
```

**Service Discovery:**
```
DEBUG: Atom.Interface@vritti/composer:::--Heard Connection--:::AgentActivated: <@vritti/ideator>
DEBUG: Successfully Initialised Connection:<NewChainOfThoughtCreated>
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Zero Configuration Change**: Existing services work without modification  
‚úÖ **Development Friendly**: Start services in any order during development  
‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Handles service restarts and failures gracefully  
‚úÖ **Container/Kubernetes Ready**: Perfect for containerized deployments  
‚úÖ **Debugging Friendly**: Clear logging shows connection status and retries  

## Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Connect After Max Retries
- Check if Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`
- Verify network connectivity between services
- Check port conflicts
- Review service configuration

### Connections Not Establishing
- Verify connection strings in config match service names exactly
- Check that target services are actually running and advertising
- Look for `AgentActivated` events in logs

### Performance Considerations
- Initial startup may take a few seconds as services discover each other
- Once all services are running, performance is identical to before
- Connection retry logic only runs during startup/failures

## Migration from Previous Version

No code changes required! The enhanced retry logic is backward compatible with existing configurations.
